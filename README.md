# Usage

```
Usage: ./NMEA_Multicast 
```
# Purpose

This program will mutlicast a predefined NMEA string to a predefined multicast group. Future work will support adding a config file to add flexibility to this program.

Compile: cc NMEA_multicast.c -o NMEA_multicast -lpthread 

# Improvements

Thoughts to improve the NMEA_Multicast program are:

1. Pass arguments in via a config file. This would allow much more flexibility and simplify the process of setting the system up to output many NMEA messages.
